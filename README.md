# Object Oriented Game
A "hangman" like game where the user will be prompted with a random phrase and can attempt to guess the phrase, one letter at a time.


## Background
Created for Project 4 of the Treehouse Fullstack Tech Degree.

 This one was pretty fun because this is my first project where I can really practice object oriented javascript. I plan to continue to make web games using what I've learned from this project.

### Future Improvements

1. Allowing the user to use their keyboard for input
2. The code could be refactored for easier readability
3. I would also like to replace many of the for loops with better iteration methods
